Permalizer
=================

Permalizer is a way to create clean URLs from strings. It is framework agnostic, meaning it’s simply just a gem that can be used in Rails, Merb, Sinatra, Camping, etc. It has two ways to use it, with the bang and without it:

“permalizer rocks!”.permalize # => “permalizer-rocks”
“permalizer rocks # => “permalizer-rocks”
